# Heart_Beat_Detection_From_Photoplethysmography_Signal
The first step applied for the heartbeat detection from the PPG signal is filtration of the signal. In this process, a
band-pass filter is used to remove frequency components that are above 5 Hz and below 0.5 Hz. Then the peaks and
valleys of the signal are detected by comparing the moving average signal with the filtered signal. At last, the detected valleys
are used for the calculation of the heartbeat and the detected heartbeats are compared with the standard heartbeat,
with the help of a box plot and bar-graphs. Further conditional selection of peaks and valleys is recommended for
accurate heartbeat detection. <\br>
